# Common Concepts and terminologies

## Loss function vs cost function

The terms **cost and loss functions** almost refer to the same meaning. The **cost function** is calculated as an average of **loss functions**. The **loss function** is a value which is calculated at every instance. So, for a single training cycle **loss** is calculated numerous times, but the **cost function** is only calculated once.
