# Support Vector Machine

Margin: Distance between the extreme point and the decision boundary.

Maximum Margin Outlier: Super sensitive to outliers in the training data. Therefore, not a good algorithm in ML.

Soft Margin: When we allow misclassifications. But how to determine the best soft margin? Using cross validation.

Support vector classifier (SVC) uses soft margins.
